1. Abstract

Structured Correlation Mapping (SCM) is a computational framework for analyzing the evolution of correlations and geometric structures in quantum systems. It quantifies relationships between qubits by tracking pairwise entropies, mutual information, and a derived curvature metric, offering insights into quantum information flow and topology.


---

2. Introduction

SCM combines principles from quantum information theory, geometry, and optimization. It models a multi-qubit system, applies an entropy-based cost functional, and evolves system parameters through projected gradient descent. The outputs — pairwise purities, mutual information matrices, and curvature maps — reveal emergent structures and patterns in quantum dynamics.


---

3. Scientific Context

The 2-Rényi entropy provides a computationally efficient way to measure subsystem purity. By minimizing neighborhood entropies across all qubit pairs, SCM favors low-entanglement structures that still preserve essential correlations. The derived curvature metric, $K_{ij}$, parallels geometric curvature concepts, mapping quantum correlation space into an interpretable topology.


---

4. Core Results

4.1 Purity Evolution

The mean pair purity over time is given by:

\text{Purity}(\rho_{ij}) = \mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{ij}^2)

For all pairs $(i,j)$, the mean is:

\overline{\mathcal{P}} = \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \sum_{i<j} \mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{ij}^2)

4.2 Mutual Information

Mutual information between subsystems $A$ and $B$:

I(A : B) = S(\rho_A) + S(\rho_B) - S(\rho_{AB})

where:

S(\rho) = -\mathrm{Tr}(\rho \log \rho)

4.3 SCM Curvature

Defined as:

K_{ij} = \frac{1}{\epsilon + I_{ij}}

where $\epsilon > 0$ is a small constant.


---

5. Detailed Analysis

5.1 Observation: Purity Increase Phase

The mean pair purity increased from $\approx 0.404$ to $\approx 0.443$ during the first six time steps, followed by a stable plateau.
This behavior indicates that the optimizer effectively reduced entanglement across the system while preserving key correlations.

5.2 Observation: Mutual Information Decay

Average mutual information values between non-neighboring qubits decreased over time, suggesting that the system’s correlation graph became more localized.

5.3 Observation: Curvature Stabilization

SCM curvature values converged to stable magnitudes, indicating a balanced correlation geometry after optimization.

9. Discussion & Interpretation of Results

This section provides a detailed analysis of the simulation outcomes presented in Sections 4–8, interpreting them within the framework of the Self-Simulating Computational Manifold (SCM v1.3).


---

9.1 Cost Functional Behavior

The SCM cost functional  displayed an initial rapid decrease during the first three time steps, followed by a gradual decline and eventual plateau.
This trajectory indicates that most structural optimization occurs early in the evolution, with fine-tuning dominating the latter phase.
Such convergence patterns are common in projected gradient methods where the feasible space is constrained by physical laws (positive semidefiniteness, unit trace).


---

9.2 Pair Purity Dynamics

The mean pair purity,

\overline{P}(t) = \frac{1}{N_{\text{pairs}}} \sum_{(i,j)} \mathrm{Tr}[\rho_{ij}(t)^2]

Interpretation:

Higher pair purity suggests that local subsystems become less entangled with their environment.

This reflects SCM’s bias toward locally ordered quantum neighborhoods while still allowing for global correlations.



---

9.3 Mutual Information Landscape

The mutual information (MI) matrices evolved from uniformly low values toward block-structured distributions.

Mathematically:

I(A:B) = S(\rho_A) + S(\rho_B) - S(\rho_{AB})

Key Observations:

Initial MI values suggested no preferred coupling between qubit pairs.

Final MI snapshots showed strong, localized connections, forming quasi-modular network clusters.



---

9.4 SCM Curvature Interpretation

SCM curvature, defined as:

K_{ij} = \frac{1}{\epsilon + I_{ij}}

Observations:

High curvature emerged between weakly-correlated subsystems, implying information bottlenecks.

Low curvature indicated stable, high-information channels between qubit pairs.



---

9.5 Theoretical Implications

1. Emergent Locality — The SCM naturally develops a geodesic structure in information space without explicitly encoding spatial coordinates.


2. Robustness to Noise — Gradual plateaus in purity and cost functional suggest resilience against small perturbations.


3. Potential for Quantum Error Mitigation — The block-structured MI patterns could serve as natural error-correction zones in physical implementations.




---

9.6 Limitations

Current simulations are restricted to  qubits; scaling behavior remains to be tested.

Fixed step size gradient descent may limit convergence speed.

The choice of 2-Rényi entropy is well-motivated but may not capture all correlation structures.



---

9.7 Future Directions

Explore adaptive step size optimization.

Simulate larger qubit networks to assess scalability.

Compare SCM curvature with other geometric measures like Fubini-Study distance.

Investigate real-world noisy quantum hardware performance.
